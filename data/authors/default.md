Martin is a slavic engineer working at the AI Lab. His research interests include complexity modeling of tailwinds, headwinds, and reactings. Sometimes nodes.

He leads the slav energy group which develops 3D air pollution-climate models, writes differential equation solvers, and manufactures titanium-plated air ballons. In his free time, he bakes cookies on his raspberry pi.

Still, reading? Now it's time for the about text. I live Czech republic. Where? Livin' in eastern central Europe in byatiful city Brno. Doing Engineering for more than 15 years and using always the best tech around.
